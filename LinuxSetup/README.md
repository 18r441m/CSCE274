# Linux Setup

### Note: This is a basic setup for the host machine that will be used during the course both to program assignments and connect to the duckiebots. For more in-depth steps, use the [DT Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/opmanual_duckiebot/out.pdf).

### Summary
* The official Linux distro supported by the course is: [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)

    * pip3
    * git 
    * git-lfs 
    * curl 
    * wget
